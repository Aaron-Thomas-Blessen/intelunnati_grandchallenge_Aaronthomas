India ranks first in the world for the number of accidents and lives lost on the roads. The country has only 1% of vehicles worldwide but has 11% of accidents worldwide. The Ministry of Road Transport (MoRTH) uses the concept of a Blackspot to mark these locations to improve road safety on national highways in the country.

The exponential growth of vehicles and accidents poses a pressing concern for road safety. It is imperative to take decisive measures to effectively address this issue in our country. Although various solutions exist, their proper implementation has been lacking thus far.

This project successfully analyzed road accident data in Tamil Nadu and found the most accident-prone areas in the city. By utilizing data analysis techniques, valuable insights were gained regarding the locations, speed, timing, and months when accidents are most prevalent. The findings of this project highlight the urgent need to address road safety concerns in Tamil Nadu and implement effective measures to reduce accidents and ensure the well-being of road users. The identification of specific accident-prone areas, such as Madipakkam, Acharapakkam West and Ganesh Nagar, provides valuable information for targeted interventions and improvements in these locations.

This project has the potential to extend beyond Tamil Nadu and encompass other cities or regions in India. By analyzing road accident data and creating maps for multiple areas, the project can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of road safety challenges on a larger scale. To enhance its impact, the project can explore the integration of real-time data sources, such as traffic cameras, sensors, and social media feeds. This integration would enable live monitoring of road conditions and accident occurrences, providing valuable insights for immediate response and proactive accident prevention measures.
